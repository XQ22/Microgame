# Microgame

A project to make a coherent game with only two objects per level and a 128x128 window.
The game consists of moving a white square using the mouse to a green square without hitting the red rectangle.

## Plan

Every 16 levels, here will be a release.
The first 128 levels are under the category of Beta Releases.
Any future levels belong under the category of Extensions.
